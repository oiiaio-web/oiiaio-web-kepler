## 使用方法 / Usage

**中文：**
安装后，在 Python 中导入并使用：

**English:**
After installation, import and use in Python:

import oiiaio_web_kepler as k

# 计算引力 / Calculate gravity
force = k.compute_gravity(5.972e24, 1000, 6371000)
print(f"引力: {force}")

# 计算轨道速度 / Calculate orbital velocity
v = k.orbital_velocity(5.972e24, 6800000)
print(f"轨道速度: {v}")

# 查询版本更新信息 / Query version update information
info = k.update_information("1.2.2")
print(f"更新信息: {info}")

# 霍曼转移轨道计算 / Hohmann transfer orbit calculation
dv1, dv2, total_dv, time = k.hohmann_transfer(6371000, 42164000, 3.986e14)
print(f"第一次点火速度增量: {dv1} m/s")
print(f"第二次点火速度增量: {dv2} m/s")
print(f"总速度增量: {total_dv} m/s")
print(f"转移时间: {time} 秒")

      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations. However, in accepting such
      obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
      sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
      and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
      Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
      asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any
      such warranty or additional liability.
